# Authentication Service

This is a basic application that utilises Scala and the Akka framework to achieve a scalable authentication service. This is primarily created for my own personal learning, however its completely free for anyone trying to learn Scala, Akka, Slick to pull apart (I doubt the code is of the best quality) its mainly a hackjob of trying new things. 

# Libraries used

As noted the project is using Scala as its predominant langauge, hence most of the libraries listed will be from this area.

- Akka Http (Http Framework)
- Bcrypt (Security Library to hash passwords securely)
- Slick (DB connection Library)
- ScalaTest (what it says on the tin)
- Slf4j (Logging library)
- PureConfig (Configuration Library)
